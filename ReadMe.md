##To use the program:

install IP Webcam on a phone

Place an object on a green surface
Place the phone over the object to be scanned

### Settings

Alter the IP address to reflect that of the recording phone
Alter the amount of recording time as desired. (More recording time means more light information but you might run into ram issues when increasing it too much)

The program will say when it is recording and during this time a lightsource (other phone flashlight) should move around the object.
after the program stated "Processing images" wait until a '.gltf' file is created
